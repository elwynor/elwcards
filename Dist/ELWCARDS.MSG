   The object of Card Sharks is to finish with the largest amount of cash
possible.  You begin with $250 in cash and must go through 5 levels of betting.
After each level you will recieve an additional $250.  The first four levels
contain 5 cards and the last level has 2 cards.  On each level one card will
be open for you to guess whether the next card will be higher or lower.  Before
the next card is revealed you must bet an amount less then or equal to what
you have on hand.  If the next card is lower and you stated that it would be
lower then you win the amount you bet.  If it is higher and you stated that
it would be higher then you also win your bet.  But if the card is not in
the direction that you stated, you LOSE!  If the card is the same then a PUSH
occurs and no money is won or lost.  On the last level you must bet at least
half your money before the last card is turned.  Also at the beginning of
each level you will be asked if you want to change that card or not.  Don't
forget that the ACE is the highest and the 2 is the lowest!
 
Now you are ready for :
