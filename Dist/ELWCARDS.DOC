 WHAT IS CARD SHARKS?

 Card Sharks is a single-player card game that has the user try to
 gain as much money as possible by betting whether or not a card
 will be higher or lower than a displayed card.  A top ten
 list keeps the competition going.
 
 GAMEPLAY
 
 The object of Card Sharks is to finish with the largest amount of cash
 possible.  You begin with $250.00 and must go through 5 levels of betting.
 After each level you will recieve an additional $250.  The first four levels
 contain 5 cards and the last level has 2 cards.  On each level one card will
 be open for you to guess whether the next card will be higher or lower. Before
 the next card is revealed you must bet an amount less then or equal to what
 you have on hand.  If the next card is lower and you stated that it would be
 lower then you win the amount you bet.  If it is higher and you stated that
 it would be higher then you also win your bet.  But if the card is not in
 the direction that you stated, you LOSE!  If the card is the same then a PUSH
 occurs and no money is won or lost.  On the last level you must bet at least
 half your money before the last card is turned.  Also at the beginning of
 each level you will be asked if you want to change that card or not.  Don't
 forget that the ACE is the highest and the 2 is the lowest!

 GAME HISTORY
 
 Card Sharks was originally written developed by Yannick Tessier in 1989 for 
 version 5 of The Major BBS.  The game was marketed by Tessier Technologies 
 (TTI), which became part of Galacticomm when TTI was merged into 
 Galacticomm, Inc in 1997, creating Galacticomm Technologies.
  
 Elwynor Technologies acquired the module in 2005, after converting it to 
 Major BBS 6/Worldgroup 1/Worldgroup 2 DOS in 2004. It was converted to 
 Worldgroup 3.2 in 2006, and Major BBS V10 in 2024.
